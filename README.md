# Java Koans   (WIP - These are not the Koans your looking for)

This is set of Koans intended to improve fundamental understanding of the Java programming language.


What are Koans?
---------------

Essentially a Koan is a problem to solve.

Or from the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) article I think the most relevant explanation is:

> Insight has to be demonstrated. A mere "answer" to a koan is not sufficient. The teacher is not looking for a specific answer, but for evidence that the disciple has grasped the state of mind expressed by the k?an itself.

I think this is particularly relevant to the field of programming.

For this I am borrowing from the idea of the original [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) which involves the practitioner fixing a number of broken unit tests. Using a unit test framework allows for rapid feedback of the topics being discussed and using an IDE we can easily insert breakpoints to explore the code at run-time.

Prerequisites
-------------

Favourite IDE with the ability to execute unit tests.

Basic understanding of the Java programming language.

Primers
-------

If you are unfamiliar with JUnit you should start with the primer rather than the exercises
